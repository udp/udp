<p>Designing biological systems is heavily dependent on knowledge, but much of this knowledge is not yet stored with a FAIR representation that is easily accessible by machines. This <b><i>knowledge representation</i></b> problem is a significant barrier to any machine automation of the design process.</p><p> The <b><i><a href="https://sbolstandard.org">Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL)</a></i></b> is an open, community developed, ontology-backed data model for the machine-tractable representation of biological designs, <b>so that computers can understand the things people build in the lab.</b></p>

<p><b><i><a href="https://synbiohub.org">SynBioHub</a></i></b> (<a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acssynbio.7b00403">paper</a>) is a project I founded in 2016 to provide an open-source FAIR design repository for people designing biological systems, using an SBOL knowledge graph under the hood. It allows information about biological designs to be uploaded and shared with other people, or accessed by machines via a REST API.</p>

<p>Ontologies are hierarchical dictionaries which are widely used in the biology and biomedical domains to enable the FAIR, machine-tractable representation of complex biological knowledge.</p>
  <p>I work on three open-source tools at EMBL-EBI for working with ontologies: the <b><i><a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols">Ontology Lookup Service (OLS)</a></i></b>, which indexes 250+ biology-related ontologies for searching and browsing; the <b><i><a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/spot/oxo">Ontology Xref Service (OxO)</a></i></b>, which maps terms from one ontology to another; and <b><i><a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/spot/zooma">ZOOMA</a></i></b>, which provides optimal mappings for strings to ontology terms.</p>

<td>
 <p>One of the major challenges in the &quot;FAIRification&quot; of biological knowledge is curating mappings from free text representations, which are often ambiguous and/or context dependent, to well-defined ontology terms.</p>
<p><b><i><a href="https://www.github.com/EBISPOT/OntoString">OntoString</a></i></b> is a tool for automating this process using mappings provided automatically by the OLS and ZOOMA APIs, while still allowing manual intervention from a human curator.</p>
